## üîÑ **Chat Management Strategy**

### **When to Start New Chat**

#### üî¥ **SWITCH NOW** - Clear Indicators:
- AI gives **incomplete/wrong answers** to simple questions
- Responses become **generic/unhelpful**
- AI **forgets things** you just told it
- You're **stuck on same issue** for >10 back-and-forth exchanges
- **Switching major features** (auth ‚Üí export ‚Üí audio cutting)
- **Different codebase areas** (frontend ‚Üî backend transitions)

#### üü¢ **KEEP GOING** - Still Effective:
- AI gives **relevant, specific answers**
- **Building on same feature/area**
- **Good momentum** on current task
- Cursor's "start new chat" warning but **performance still good**

### **Message Counting Reality**
- ‚úÖ **Your question = 1 message** (length doesn't matter)
- ‚úÖ **AI's long response = 1 message**
- ‚úÖ **Tool calls = don't count** toward limits
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Switch based on quality**, not quantity

## üéØ **Context Feeding Strategies**

### **Tiered Approach - Use Right Level for Each Task**

#### **Level 1: Quick Tasks (90% of use cases)**
```
"I want to add [FEATURE] to my [APP TYPE].

Current setup: [BRIEF TECH STACK]

Please read these files to understand current system:
- [FILE 1 - main logic]
- [FILE 2 - related component]  
- [FILE 3 - UI/interface]

Then tell me exactly what to modify."
```

**Example:**
```
"I want to add MP3 export to my audiobook app.

Current setup: Flask backend, JavaScript frontend, pydub for audio.

Please read these files:
- backend/services/export_service.py
- frontend/js/modules/export.js

Then tell me exactly what to modify for MP3 support."
```

#### **Level 2: Complex Features (New major functionality)**
```
"I'm adding [COMPLEX FEATURE] to my app.

First, read my architecture guide: @ARCHITECTURE_GUIDE.md

Then analyze these key files:
- [CORE FILE 1]
- [INTEGRATION FILE 2]
- [UI FILE 3]

Create implementation plan with exact modification points."
```

#### **Level 3: Large Debugging (When stuck)**
```
"I have [ISSUE TYPE] across my app.

Read my documentation: @RELEVANT_GUIDE.md
Then scan these files for problems:
- [ERROR SOURCE FILE]
- [RELATED SYSTEM FILE]

Error: [PASTE EXACT ERROR MESSAGE]
What's broken and how to fix?"
```

### **‚ùå Anti-Patterns (Don't Do This)**
```
‚ùå "Analyze my entire codebase and then add [feature]"
‚ùå "Read all files and understand everything first"  
‚ùå "Here are 50 files, figure out what's relevant"
‚ùå "Just look at my code and fix whatever's wrong"
```

### **‚úÖ Proven Patterns (Do This)**
```
‚úÖ Target 2-4 specific files maximum initially
‚úÖ Use your documentation as primary context
‚úÖ Be specific about desired outcome
‚úÖ Let AI request additional files if needed
‚úÖ Provide exact error messages when debugging
```

## üìù **Documentation Creation Workflow**

### **Step-by-Step Process**

#### **Phase 1: Discovery & Analysis**
```
"Analyze my codebase structure systematically:

1. Use list_dir to understand project organization
2. Read key files to understand architecture  
3. Identify main components and their interactions
4. Focus on [SPECIFIC AREA] if provided

Don't assume anything - verify by reading actual code."
```

#### **Phase 2: Focused Documentation**
```
"Create a [FEATURE]_GUIDE.md that documents:

üîç WHAT TO INCLUDE:
- All functions related to [feature]
- File organization for this feature
- How components interact  
- Current limitations
- Extension points for new functionality
- Exact code patterns used

üìã FORMAT:
- Clear headings and sections
- Code examples with line references
- Implementation guidelines
- Troubleshooting common issues"
```

#### **Phase 3: Verification**
```
"Compare this documentation to actual code:
- Are there any inaccuracies?
- Missing important functions?
- Outdated patterns?
- Need to scan additional files?"
```

### **Documentation Types & Prompts**

#### **Architecture Documentation**
```
"Map out my entire codebase structure and create an architecture 
guide showing:
- How all major components fit together
- Data flow between frontend/backend
- Database relationships
- Authentication patterns
- File upload/processing workflows"
```

#### **Feature-Specific Guides**
```
"Document my complete [SYSTEM] - every function, every file, 
every pattern used. Include:
- Function signatures and purposes
- Integration points
- Current capabilities vs limitations
- Best practices for extending"
```

#### **Function Reference**
```
"Create comprehensive function reference for all major functions:
- Exact signatures with parameters
- Return values and types
- Usage examples
- Dependencies and relationships
- Extension points for new features"
```

---

## üîç **File Discovery & Relevance**

### **Start Small, Expand Systematically**

#### **Initial File Selection Strategy**
```
1. Guess 2-3 files based on feature name/area
2. Ask AI: "What other files might be affected?"  
3. AI requests additional files as needed
4. Gradually build complete picture
```

#### **Discovery Prompts**
```
"What other files might be affected by adding [FEATURE]?"
"Scan my codebase - what files handle [FUNCTIONALITY]?"
"Search for functions related to [SPECIFIC AREA]"
"Are there dependencies I'm missing for this change?"
```

#### **Systematic Exploration**
```
"Before implementing [FEATURE], help me identify:
- All files that might need modification
- Potential integration points
- Existing similar functionality
- Dependencies and requirements"
```

---

## üìÑ **Handling Large Documentation**

### **AI Reading Behavior**
- ‚úÖ **WILL read full 1000+ line docs** when referenced with `@filename.md`
- ‚úÖ **Processes entire content** with read_file tool
- ‚úÖ **Can handle multiple large docs** in same conversation
- ‚ùå **May skip details** if just mentioned casually

### **Best Practices for Large Docs**

#### **Effective Referencing**
```
‚úÖ GOOD: "@AUTHENTICATION_FLOW_GUIDE.md - read this completely 
before helping me fix login issue"

‚úÖ GOOD: "Read my full function reference (it's comprehensive): 
@FUNCTION_REFERENCE_GUIDE.md"

‚úÖ GOOD: "Study the architecture in @CODEBASE_GUIDE.md then 
suggest implementation approach"

‚ùå POOR: "Check my docs somewhere for auth info"
‚ùå POOR: "Look at documentation if needed"
```

#### **Documentation Size Guidelines**
- **500-1000 lines**: Optimal size, AI handles excellently
- **1000-2000 lines**: Still good, may need section references
- **2000+ lines**: Consider splitting into focused docs

#### **Structuring Large Docs**
```
üìã GOOD STRUCTURE:
- Clear table of contents
- Logical section breaks
- Code examples with context
- Cross-references between sections
- Summary sections for complex topics

üéØ NAVIGATION AIDS:
- Section headers with emojis
- "Extension Points" clearly marked
- "Current State" vs "Future Plans"
- Troubleshooting sections
```

## üöÄ **Optimal Workflow Patterns**

### **Feature Implementation Process**

#### **1. Planning Phase**
```
"I want to add [FEATURE] to my app.

Context: [BRIEF APP DESCRIPTION]
Goal: [SPECIFIC OUTCOME]

Please read: @ARCHITECTURE_GUIDE.md and these files:
- [RELEVANT FILE 1]  
- [RELEVANT FILE 2]

Create detailed implementation plan BEFORE coding."
```

#### **2. Implementation Phase**
```
"Following our plan, let's implement step [X]:

Read current code: [SPECIFIC FILE]
Modify exactly: [SPECIFIC FUNCTION/SECTION]
Preserve: [EXISTING FUNCTIONALITY]
Add: [NEW FUNCTIONALITY]

Show me exact changes needed."
```

#### **3. Integration Phase**
```
"Now integrate this change with existing system:

Check these files for impacts:
- [INTEGRATION FILE 1]
- [INTEGRATION FILE 2]

Test that existing functionality still works."
```

#### **4. Verification Phase**
```
"Verify implementation against requirements:
- [REQUIREMENT 1] - working?
- [REQUIREMENT 2] - working?  
- No existing functionality broken?
- Ready for testing?"
```

### **Debugging Workflow**

#### **Problem Identification**
```
"I have this specific error: [EXACT ERROR MESSAGE]

Context: I was trying to [WHAT YOU WERE DOING]

Read: @RELEVANT_GUIDE.md and [ERROR SOURCE FILE]

What's the root cause and exact fix?"
```

#### **Systematic Debugging**
```
"Let's debug systematically:

1. Confirm the error location
2. Check related functions  
3. Verify all dependencies
4. Test minimal fix first
5. Ensure no side effects"
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Common Pitfalls & Solutions**

### **Context Overload**
‚ùå **Problem**: Giving too much information upfront
‚úÖ **Solution**: Start focused, expand as needed

### **Vague Requests**
‚ùå **Problem**: "Fix my authentication system"
‚úÖ **Solution**: "Fix this specific login error: [EXACT ERROR]"

### **Assumption-Based Development**
‚ùå **Problem**: "Add feature X (AI assumes implementation)"  
‚úÖ **Solution**: "Read current code, then plan implementation"

### **Documentation Neglect**
‚ùå **Problem**: Starting fresh every chat
‚úÖ **Solution**: Build and reference documentation consistently

### **Tool Misuse**
‚ùå **Problem**: Not letting AI read files completely
‚úÖ **Solution**: Use read_file and grep_search tools effectively
